# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Message Abstraction Layer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a unified message interface that normalizes communications from different channels (email, WhatsApp, live chat) into a consistent format for the unified inbox.
# Details:
Design IMessage interface with common fields: id, channel, sender, recipient, content, attachments, metadata, timestamp. Create channel-specific adapters that transform native formats to IMessage. Implement message storage with channel-specific data preservation. Build message rendering system that handles rich media and formatting. Create attachment handling system with virus scanning and size limits. Implement message threading logic for conversation continuity.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test each channel adapter with sample data. Test message normalization preserves all critical information. Validate attachment handling with various file types. Test threading logic maintains conversation context.
