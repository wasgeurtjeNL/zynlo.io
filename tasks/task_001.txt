# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Monorepo Infrastructure with Turborepo
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project foundation with a Turborepo monorepo structure, configure workspaces for frontend dashboard, API webhook server, and shared packages. Set up development environment with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier.
# Details:
Create root package.json with Turborepo configuration. Set up workspaces: apps/dashboard (Next.js 14+), apps/webhook-server (Express.js), packages/ui (component library), packages/database (Supabase client), packages/types (shared TypeScript types). Configure tsconfig.json for each workspace with proper path aliases. Set up .env files structure for different environments. Initialize Git with proper .gitignore. Configure Docker setup for containerized deployment.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all workspaces can be built independently. Test that shared packages are properly linked. Ensure hot reload works across workspaces. Validate TypeScript compilation and linting passes.
