# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Core UI Component Library
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive React component library using Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS, implementing design system with dark/light theme support and accessibility compliance.
# Details:
Set up packages/ui with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. Create base components: Button, Input, Select, Dialog, Toast, Card, Badge, Avatar, Dropdown. Implement theme system with CSS variables for dark/light modes. Build layout components: Sidebar, Header, PageContainer. Create specialized components: TicketCard, MessageBubble, ChannelIcon, StatusBadge. Implement keyboard navigation hooks. Set up Storybook for component documentation. Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper ARIA labels.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test all components with React Testing Library. Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility. Visual regression testing with Storybook. Validate theme switching works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up UI package infrastructure with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the packages/ui directory with necessary dependencies, configuration files, and build setup for the component library
### Details:
Create packages/ui directory structure. Install Radix UI primitives (@radix-ui/react-*), Tailwind CSS, and required build tools. Configure tsconfig.json for React components.

- TypeScript and React setup working
- cn utility already implemented

Build output:
- ESM build: dist/index.mjs
- CJS build: dist/index.js

## 2. Implement theme system with dark/light mode support [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive theming system using CSS variables that supports dark and light modes with smooth transitions
### Details:
Define CSS variables for colors, spacing, typography, and shadows in :root and [data-theme='dark']. Create ThemeProvider component with context API for theme switching. Implement useTheme hook for accessing theme state. Set up automatic theme detection based on system preferences. Create theme toggle component. Ensure all CSS variables follow consistent naming convention.
<info added on 2025-05-29T19:17:06.566Z>
Completed theme system implementation:

Created ThemeProvider component with Context API for global theme state management, system preference detection using matchMedia API, LocalStorage persistence with configurable storage key, automatic application of theme to document root, support for both data-theme attribute and dark class, and prevention of flash of incorrect theme on load.

Implemented useTheme hook that provides access to current theme, setTheme function, and system theme with proper error handling when used outside provider and TypeScript types exported for reuse.

Created ThemeToggle component with beautiful animated transitions between sun/moon icons, multiple size variants (sm, md, lg), accessibility features including aria-label and keyboard support, and customizable className for styling overrides.

Created ThemeSwitch component as an alternative switch-style toggle with optional labels for better UX, smooth sliding animation, and ARIA switch role for accessibility.

Updated configuration to add dark mode support to Tailwind config, supporting both class and data-theme attribute, and added font family CSS variables.

Created comprehensive Storybook stories for both toggle variants with decorator to wrap stories with ThemeProvider and examples of all size variants and configurations.

Verified build with all components building successfully, TypeScript types properly generated, and no build errors. The theme system is now fully functional with automatic system preference detection, manual override capability, and persistent storage.

## 3. Build base UI components with Radix primitives [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Create foundational components (Button, Input, Select, Dialog, Toast, Card, Badge, Avatar, Dropdown) using Radix UI primitives with full accessibility support
