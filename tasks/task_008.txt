# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Real-time Collaboration Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build team collaboration capabilities including real-time presence indicators, internal comments, @mentions system, and collision detection for simultaneous editing.
# Details:
Implement presence system using Supabase Realtime with online/away/busy states. Create internal comments feature with visibility controls (hidden from customers). Build @mentions system with autocomplete and notification triggers. Implement collision detection using optimistic locking to prevent simultaneous responses. Add activity feed showing ticket history and agent actions in real-time. Create typing indicators for live collaboration awareness. Build notification system with in-app and email notifications.

# Test Strategy:
Test presence updates across multiple connected clients. Verify internal comments never appear in customer responses. Test @mention notifications reach intended recipients. Validate collision detection prevents data loss. Test real-time updates with network interruptions.
