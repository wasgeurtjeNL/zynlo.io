# Task ID: 2
# Title: Initialize Supabase Database and Authentication
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Supabase project with PostgreSQL database, configure authentication system with email/password and OAuth providers, implement Row Level Security policies for multi-tenant architecture.
# Details:
Create Supabase project and configure environment variables. Design and implement core database schema: users (with roles: agent, team_lead, admin), organizations (multi-tenant support), teams, tickets, conversations, messages, attachments, tags. Set up RLS policies for tenant isolation. Configure Supabase Auth with email confirmation, password reset flows. Implement OAuth2 providers (Google, Microsoft, GitHub). Create database migrations and seed data scripts. Set up real-time subscriptions for live updates.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flows (signup, login, logout, password reset). Verify RLS policies prevent cross-tenant data access. Validate real-time subscriptions work for ticket updates. Test database migrations rollback and forward.
