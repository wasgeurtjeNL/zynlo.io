The implementation leverages the mailparser library's simpleParser for comprehensive MIME message parsing with support for all content types and encodings. Header extraction is handled through a Map<string, string[]> structure with specialized processing for threading headers (Message-ID, In-Reply-To, References) and address fields. The parseAddresses() method provides robust address parsing that handles various email formats and normalizes them into a consistent structure. Content extraction supports both text/plain and text/html with automatic base64 decoding and proper multipart message handling. Attachment metadata is efficiently extracted without downloading full content, capturing filename, content type, and size information. The convertParsedMail() method serves as the central transformation point, converting ParsedMail objects to the EmailMessage interface while handling all edge cases and preserving original data integrity.

Generate secure, time-limited URLs for attachment access. Implement virus scanning integration for attachments before storage.\n<info added on 2025-05-29T21:10:59.480Z>\nStarted implementation of email thread reconstruction and attachment storage.\n\nAnalysis of existing code revealed that email threading infrastructure already captures Message-ID, In-Reply-To, and References headers in the messages table metadata. The current process-email/index.ts has basic thread detection but lacks sophisticated reconstruction algorithms. For attachments, the storage bucket 'ticket-attachments' is configured with RLS policies and a 10MB file size limit, but automatic extraction and streaming upload of email attachments is not yet implemented.\n\nImplementation plan consists of four phases:\n\nPhase 1: Email Thread Reconstruction Service - Creating thread-reconstructor.ts service with algorithm to group messages by headers, fallback to subject matching (removing Re:/Fwd: prefixes), time-based grouping for same subject within 7 days, and handling of broken threads and missing headers.\n\nPhase 2: Attachment Extraction & Storage Service - Creating attachment-handler.ts service to extract attachments from EmailMessage objects, stream upload to Supabase Storage with chunking for large files, generate secure paths and metadata.\n\nPhase 3: Integration Points - Updating email webhook processing to use thread reconstruction, modifying email processing to extract and store attachments, adding attachment URLs to message records, implementing cleanup for orphaned attachments.\n\nPhase 4: Database Updates - Adding indexes for thread queries, considering thread_id column for tickets table, adding attachment metadata table for better tracking.\n</info added on 2025-05-29T21:10:59.480Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-29T21:18:51.263Z>\nSuccessfully implemented email thread reconstruction and attachment storage functionality.\n\n## Completed Implementation:\n\n### 1. Thread Reconstruction Service (thread-reconstructor.ts)\n- **findExistingThread()**: Finds existing threads using Message-ID, In-Reply-To, and References headers\n- Falls back to subject matching with normalization (removes Re:/Fwd: prefixes, ticket numbers)\n- Time-based grouping for messages with same subject within 7 days\n- **reconstructThread()**: Rebuilds full email thread from database\n- **buildReferenceChain()**: Creates proper reference chain for replies\n- **groupOrphanedMessages()**: Groups messages without headers into threads\n\n### 2. Attachment Handler Service (attachment-handler.ts)\n- **processEmailAttachments()**: Processes all attachments from an email\n- Validates MIME types against allowed list from storage bucket config\n- Enforces 10MB file size limit\n- Generates secure storage paths: tickets/{ticketId}/{messageId}/{timestamp}-{filename}\n- Calculates MD5 checksums for integrity\n- Stores attachment metadata in message's attachments JSONB array\n- **generateSecureDownloadUrl()**: Creates time-limited signed URLs\n- **deleteAttachment()**: Removes from storage and database\n- **cleanupOrphanedAttachments()**: Batch cleanup of old attachments\n\n### 3. Integration Updates\n- Updated email webhook to use thread reconstruction instead of simple ticket ID extraction\n- Webhook now processes attachments through attachment handler\n- Converts base64 encoded attachments to Buffer for storage\n- Handles attachment upload failures gracefully without failing webhook\n\n### 4. Database Optimizations\n- Added indexes for Message-ID, In-Reply-To, References in metadata JSONB\n- GIN indexes for array searches in references\n- Composite indexes for conversation/sender queries\n- Indexes for cleanup operations on old data\n\n### Key Features Implemented:\n1. **Smart Thread Detection**: Uses email headers first, falls back to subject matching\n2. **Attachment Security**: MIME type validation, size limits, sanitized filenames\n3. **Storage Efficiency**: Organized folder structure, metadata tracking\n4. **Performance**: Database indexes for fast thread queries\n5. **Cleanup**: Automated orphaned attachment removal\n\n### Not Yet Implemented:\n- Streaming upload for very large attachments (placeholder exists)\n- Virus scanning integration (placeholder exists)\n- Real-time attachment progress tracking\n\nThe implementation successfully handles email threading and attachment storage as specified in the task requirements.\n</info added on 2025-05-29T21:18:51.263Z>",
