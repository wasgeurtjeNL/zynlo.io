## 2. Implement Email Parsing and MIME Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build comprehensive email parsing system to handle multipart MIME messages, extract headers, body content, and identify attachments
### Details:
Use mailparser or similar library for MIME parsing. Extract and parse all relevant headers (From, To, CC, BCC, Subject, Date, Message-ID, References, In-Reply-To). Handle multipart messages including text/plain, text/html, and mixed content types. Parse nested message structures and embedded images. Extract attachment metadata without downloading full content. Normalize email addresses and handle various encoding formats (quoted-printable, base64).
<info added on 2025-05-29T20:20:35.763Z>
The email parsing and MIME handling functionality has been fully implemented within the IMAP client module (imap-client.ts) rather than as a separate component. The implementation leverages the mailparser library's simpleParser for comprehensive MIME message parsing with support for all content types and encodings. Header extraction is handled through a Map<string, string[]> structure with specialized processing for threading headers (Message-ID, In-Reply-To, References) and address fields. The parseAddresses() method provides robust address parsing that handles various email formats and normalizes them into a consistent structure. Content extraction supports both text/plain and text/html with automatic base64 decoding and proper multipart message handling. Attachment metadata is efficiently extracted without downloading full content, capturing filename, content type, and size information. The convertParsedMail() method serves as the central transformation point, converting ParsedMail objects to the EmailMessage interface while handling all edge cases and preserving original data integrity. This integrated approach eliminates the need for a separate email parsing service.

## 3. Create SMTP Service for Sending Emails [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement SMTP client service with proper authentication, header management, and support for threading and email standards
### Details:
Use nodemailer with SMTP transport. Implement OAuth2 authentication for Gmail and Outlook SMTP servers. Generate proper email headers including Message-ID, References, and In-Reply-To for threading. Handle recipient validation, email address formatting, and DKIM signing if required. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed sends. Support both plain text and HTML email composition with automatic plain text fallback generation.
<info added on 2025-05-29T20:32:16.197Z>
Successfully implemented SMTP service for sending emails. Completed SMTP client (smtp-client.ts) with full nodemailer integration, OAuth2 authentication support for Gmail and Outlook, password authentication fallback, connection pooling with automatic reconnection, retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts), proper email header generation (Message-ID, In-Reply-To, References), threading support for replies, forward email functionality, attachment support with multiple formats, and comprehensive error handling and recovery.

Integrated SMTP client management into EmailService with unified interface for sending emails, support for reply and forward operations, email send logging to database, and channel-based email sending. Created API endpoints (routes/email/send.ts) including POST /email/send for flexible channel selection, POST /email/test/:channelId for testing, with channel detection by direct channelId, ticket ID, or from email address. Implemented proper reply handling with threading headers, attachment support (base64 encoded), message record creation for ticket replies, and comprehensive error handling and validation.

Updated email poller with SMTP configuration for channel initialization, graceful shutdown handling, and automatic startup on server launch. The SMTP service now supports multi-provider functionality (Gmail, Outlook, custom SMTP), OAuth2 and password authentication, connection pooling for performance, automatic retry on failures, full email threading support, rich text and plain text emails, attachment handling, and test email functionality. The service is fully integrated with the existing email infrastructure and ready for production use.

## 4. Build Email Thread Reconstruction and Attachment Storage [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement logic to reconstruct email conversations into threads and handle attachment extraction and storage in Supabase
### Details:
Create thread reconstruction algorithm using Message-ID, References, and In-Reply-To headers. Handle cases where headers are missing by falling back to subject matching and time-based grouping. Implement attachment extraction with streaming to Supabase Storage to handle large files efficiently. Create attachment metadata records in database linking to emails. Generate secure, time-limited URLs for attachment access. Implement virus scanning integration for attachments before storage.
<info added on 2025-05-29T21:10:59.480Z>
Started implementation of email thread reconstruction and attachment storage.

Analysis of existing code revealed that email threading infrastructure already captures Message-ID, In-Reply-To, and References headers in the messages table metadata. The current process-email/index.ts has basic thread detection but lacks sophisticated reconstruction algorithms. For attachments, the storage bucket 'ticket-attachments' is configured with RLS policies and a 10MB file size limit, but automatic extraction and streaming upload of email attachments is not yet implemented.

Implementation plan consists of four phases:

Phase 1: Email Thread Reconstruction Service - Creating thread-reconstructor.ts service with algorithm to group messages by headers, fallback to subject matching (removing Re:/Fwd: prefixes), time-based grouping for same subject within 7 days, and handling of broken threads and missing headers.

Phase 2: Attachment Extraction & Storage Service - Creating attachment-handler.ts service to extract attachments from EmailMessage objects, stream upload to Supabase Storage with chunking for large files, generate secure paths and metadata.

Phase 3: Integration Points - Updating email webhook processing to use thread reconstruction, modifying email processing to extract and store attachments, adding attachment URLs to message records, implementing cleanup for orphaned attachments.

Phase 4: Database Updates - Adding indexes for thread queries, considering thread_id column for tickets table, adding attachment metadata table for better tracking.

- Stores attachment metadata in message's attachments JSONB array
- **generateSecureDownloadUrl()**: Creates time-limited signed URLs
- **deleteAttachment()**: Removes from storage and database
- **cleanupOrphanedAttachments()**: Batch cleanup of old attachments

### 3. Integration Updates
- Updated email webhook to use thread reconstruction instead of simple ticket ID extraction
- Webhook now processes attachments through attachment handler
- Converts base64 encoded attachments to Buffer for storage
- Handles attachment upload failures gracefully without failing webhook

### 4. Database Optimizations
- Added indexes for Message-ID, In-Reply-To, References in metadata JSONB
- GIN indexes for array searches in references
