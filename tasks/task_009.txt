# Task ID: 9
# Title: Build Analytics Dashboard and Reporting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Create comprehensive analytics system with real-time metrics dashboard, agent performance tracking, custom report builder, and data export capabilities.
# Details:
Design analytics database schema with materialized views for performance. Build real-time dashboard with key metrics: average response time, resolution time, ticket volume, customer satisfaction. Implement agent performance tracking: tickets handled, response times, quality scores. Create channel comparison analytics showing performance across email, WhatsApp, chat. Build custom report builder with drag-drop interface and saved reports. Add data export functionality (CSV, PDF) with scheduled reports. Implement caching layer for expensive queries.

# Test Strategy:
Test metric calculations accuracy with known datasets. Verify real-time updates don't impact performance. Test report builder generates valid SQL queries. Validate exports contain correct data formatting. Load test dashboard with concurrent users.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Analytics Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create optimized database schema for analytics data storage including tables for metrics, agent performance, and channel data with materialized views for query performance
### Details:
Design tables for: metrics_raw (timestamp, metric_type, value, metadata), agent_performance (agent_id, timestamp, tickets_handled, avg_response_time, quality_score), channel_metrics (channel_type, timestamp, volume, avg_resolution_time), customer_satisfaction (ticket_id, score, timestamp). Create materialized views for hourly/daily aggregations. Implement partitioning by date for large tables. Add indexes on commonly queried fields (timestamp, agent_id, channel_type)

## 2. Build Real-Time Metrics Dashboard Backend [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement backend services and APIs for real-time metrics collection and aggregation including WebSocket support for live updates
### Details:
Create metrics collection service to capture events from ticket system. Implement aggregation service for real-time calculations (5-min, hourly windows). Build REST API endpoints: GET /metrics/realtime, GET /metrics/historical, GET /agents/performance. Add WebSocket endpoint for live dashboard updates. Implement Redis-based caching layer with TTL for expensive queries. Create background jobs for materialized view refresh

## 3. Develop Interactive Dashboard Frontend [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create responsive web dashboard with real-time charts, KPI widgets, and drill-down capabilities for metrics visualization
### Details:
Build dashboard layout with grid system for customizable widget placement. Implement real-time charts using Chart.js or D3.js for: ticket volume trends, average response times, resolution time distribution, customer satisfaction scores. Create KPI cards showing current values with trend indicators. Add date range selector and refresh controls. Implement drill-down functionality from summary to detailed views. Add responsive design for mobile/tablet viewing

## 4. Create Custom Report Builder Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Develop drag-and-drop report builder allowing users to create, save, and share custom reports with various visualization options
### Details:
Build drag-drop interface for report components (tables, charts, filters). Implement report template system with predefined layouts. Create query builder translating UI selections to SQL. Add visualization options: line charts, bar charts, pie charts, data tables. Implement report saving with versioning and sharing capabilities. Add report scheduling system for automated generation. Create report preview mode with export options

## 5. Implement Data Export and Scheduled Reports [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Build comprehensive data export functionality supporting multiple formats and automated report distribution via email
### Details:
Implement export engines for CSV (streaming for large datasets), PDF (using Puppeteer or similar for formatted reports), Excel with multiple sheets and formatting. Create job queue system for scheduled reports using Bull or similar. Build email template system for report delivery. Add export API endpoints with authentication. Implement progress tracking for large exports. Create admin interface for managing scheduled reports
